# Exchange-Rates
###### - Download from the openexchangerates.org website the exchange rates from 2007-2012 for each month for day 18
#####  -(Beware! You can make 1000 queries per month so try to download it only once. 
###### - Define the following list of currencies
###### - curr = ["HUF", "CZK", "CHF", "JPY", "BRL", "ARS", "RUB", "EUR", "IRR", "CAD", "VND", "RON", "AUD"]
###### - Create a list for each currency in curr which contains the exchange rates
###### - Normalize the values in each list. i.e. divide all values by the average exchange rate of that given currency
###### - Combine these lists to a 2d numpy array
###### - Create a dendogram for these currencies using average linkage
